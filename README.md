# Legacy-World1-6Essentials
⚠️ `This is the legacy 1.12.2 version of World1-6Essentials.` ⚠️

`May not get updated as much as the latest version of World1-6Essentials. Nor will it get new features as the latest version. Or get any updates at all`

This is an essentials plugin that I've made for a Private Minecraft Server called World1-6.

I only support the latest and greatest version of Minecraft. I will not support older versions of Minecraft.
Except for 1.12.2; occasionally I will update that version.

This plugin was made due to the fact that EssentialsX overrides some Minecraft Commands.
Even though I could've easily forked EssentialsX and fixed that. I didn't though so I just made this.
